WISHLIST:
* Add more complete unit testing
* Good and proper error handling (e.g. API cannot be reached, etc)

NOTES:
1. Please ignore usage of copyright images (this being an internal project)
2. I did not use the minified scripts because the non-minified once give better debug info (e.g. stack trace)
3. Perhaps this is a carry-over from years of WPF work, but putting every little property into a CSS in a separate file seems like a bad idea. Obviously CSS is wonderful for elements that are reused so that style changes can be made globally, but it seems counterproductive to use it to define properties that will be used once and only once for a specific single element.
4. Didn't wrap JavaScript in (function() { ... })() to avoid clutter
5. Wanted to make it bare-bones, but in a real system would use Bootstrap for flexible layout
6. "A user's cart must show them the total of their items" - A number of interpretations are possible: I chose this to mean the number of physical items in the cart, taking quantity into consideration.

BUGS - OUTSTANDING:
3. Image aspect ratio is screwed up
4. Revisit this bug - see if either way can be removed now that we fixed redundant navigation to /home


BUGS - SOLVED
1. Cart total not updated on quantity update. Consider removing binding and add button. Why did angular update some but not all required fields???
2. Entering zero or negative for quantity gives NaN as total

4. Navigate to non-search page (e.g. 'contact us'), enter a search term, and click search => you get featured products. Reason: the constructor function gets called every time a screen is entered. Possible solution is to use $rootScope to keep track of current search term.

- Must load on first-time use
- Must do search if clicked from search-results page
- Must do search if clicked from a NON-search-results page
